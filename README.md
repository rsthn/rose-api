# Rose Web Service Project Skeleton

# Configuration

Ensure you have a `rose-env` file on the root of this project with the name of the appropriate configuration environment to use (i.e. `dev`, `prod`, etc). Also edit the `rcore/*.conf` files to reflect the configuration of your system. Note that the `rose-env` file should not be commited to ensure it is never overwritten in destination servers.
